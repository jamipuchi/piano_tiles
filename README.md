# Piano Tiles
I made the game 'Piano Tiles'.
## Functionality
It works as it should, you can Play, when you click on a black tile you earn one point and when you click somewhere else or an unclicked tile reaches the bottom you lose.
## How to run
Download the file, extract it anywhere, and open the index.html. You should see the game running!
